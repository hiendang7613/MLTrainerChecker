# MLTrainer Checker

MLTrainer Checker is a Python tool designed to validate machine learning models implemented on different machine learning platforms, ensuring they are working correctly. 

## Features

- **Model Validation:** MLTrainer Checker validates machine learning models to ensure they are functioning as expected, helping you catch errors and issues early in the development process.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** It supports models built on various machine learning platforms, making it versatile for different projects.

## Installation

You can install MLTrainer Checker using `pip`:

```bash
pip install mltrainer-checker
```

## Usage

To use MLTrainer Checker in your project, follow these steps:

1. Import the library:

    ```python
    import mltrainer_checker as mltc
    ```

2. Create an instance of `MLTrainerChecker` with your trained machine learning model:

    ```python
    # import your projects
    import sys
    sys.path.append('/content/CustomKnowledgeGraphEmbedding/')
    from tensorflow_codes.supervisor import getTFTrainer
    sys.path.append('/content/CustomKnowledgeGraphEmbedding/KnowledgeGraphEmbedding')
    from codes.model import getTorchTrainer
    
    # Get your trainers
    tf_trainer, tf_model, tf_optimizer, tf_dataloader, tf_test_loader =getTFTrainer()
    torch_trainer, torch_model, torch_optimizer = getTorchTrainer()
    ```

3. Validate your model:

    ```python
    mltc.test_trainer(
      tf_trainer, torch_trainer,
      tf_model, torch_model,
      tf_optimizer, torch_optimizer,
      tf_train_loader=tf_dataloader,
      tf_test_loader=tf_test_loader,
      batch_size=2,
      loader_length=10
      )
    ```

4. Analyze the results to ensure your model is working correctly.
